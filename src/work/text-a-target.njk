  <p>To assist guests in finding items in stores being remodeled, Target pulled out all the stops.</p>
  <p>One of the stops was standing up an SMS-based store search, which allowed users without the Target application to find items in
        the store.</p>
  <p>The service ran for 8 months in 47 stores and sent/received over 500,000 messages.</p>
