    <p>
      After hearing that bras were being designed by interviewing women asking about their fit, I proposed that we bring telemetry into
      the mix.
    </p>
    <p>
      We added an array of wireless telemetry to the outside of bras being tested, which painted a much clearer
      picture of the bra&rsquo;s fit.  The sensors communicated to a browser-based client with low-energy Bluetooth.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also learned that Altoid tins make for poor containers of radio equipment &amp; that cloth/plastic are a better option.
