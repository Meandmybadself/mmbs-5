  <p>My wife &amp; I play <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee'>NYTimes' Spelling Bee</a> daily, but by different rules.  She's always played by the rules as dictated by <i>The New York Times</i>, and I simply look for pangrams.</p>
  <p>To scratch this daily itch, I made a modification of the game where the sole objective is to find pangrams.</p>
  <p>Play today at <a href="https://allpangrams.meandmybadself.com">https://allpangrams.meandmybadself.com</a>
