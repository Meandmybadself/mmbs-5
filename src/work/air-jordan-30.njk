 <p>
    When our attractive friends @ AKQA needed a high-touch, responsive, internationalized site built to tell the story of the 30th
    Anniversary of the Air Jordan sneaker, they gave us a call.
</p>
<p>
    This experience tells the shoeâ€™s making-of story and highlights NBA phenom Russell Westbrook... with beautiful animations... in
    nine languages... and no text orphans.

    <p>Nike is a discerning client, and I never would have gotten this completed to their high standards without the development help of Max Thorson.</p>
